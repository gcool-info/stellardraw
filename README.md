In Stellar Draw, you have to draw your own constellation using the  real positions of stars. The software will then generate a custom visualisation of your creation. You will also be able to get a .svg file, ready for laser-cutting! Then, it's up to you to create a necklace, earings or even a keychain!

_Note: you need to manipulate slightly the .svg file. This tutorial guides you through the process : http://www.instructables.com/id/Javascript-generated-laser-cut-jewellery/step9/Clean-it-up-in-inkscape/_
